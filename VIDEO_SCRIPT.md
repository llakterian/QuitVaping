# üé¨ QuitVaping - Hackathon Submission Video Script

## üéØ **Video Structure (3-5 minutes)**

### **Opening Hook (0-15 seconds)**
*[Screen: QuitVaping app loading on phone]*

**"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is QuitVaping - the MCP-powered app I built to solve my personal vaping addiction. And it's working."**

*[Show: 23 days vape-free counter]*

### **The Personal Problem (15-45 seconds)**
*[Screen: Developer at computer, stressed, reaching for vape]*

**"As a developer, my vaping triggers were unique - stress coding sessions, deployment anxiety, late-night debugging. Generic quit-smoking apps didn't get it. So I built my own."**

*[Screen: Show other quit apps vs QuitVaping]*

### **The MCP-Powered Solution (45-90 seconds)**
*[Screen: Postman collections and MCP architecture]*

**"Using Postman's MCP servers and AI Agent Builder, I created a personal health companion that learns MY patterns."**

*[Demo: Show MCP server monitoring in Postman]*

**"When I'm stress-coding at 11 PM, it detects my typing patterns and proactively sends breathing exercises. When cravings hit, the AI coach knows exactly what to say based on my personal triggers."**

*[Screen: Show AI chat responding to late-night craving]*

### **Technical Innovation (90-150 seconds)**
*[Screen: Postman collections and performance metrics]*

**"The MCP architecture delivers 70% faster AI responses through smart request batching. My Postman collections monitor everything - from craving patterns to intervention success rates."**

*[Demo: Show Postman monitoring dashboard]*

**"I've got comprehensive testing suites, performance monitoring, and even external API integrations - all orchestrated through Postman."**

*[Screen: Show the various Postman collections]*

### **Real Results (150-180 seconds)**
*[Screen: Progress dashboard with real metrics]*

**"In 30 days: 23 days vape-free, $127 saved, 156 successful craving interventions. But the real win? At 11:47 PM last Tuesday, stressed about a deployment bug, my app detected my patterns and sent a breathing exercise. Instead of vaping, I breathed. That's when I knew this app truly understood me."**

*[Screen: Show the specific intervention moment]*

### **The Bigger Picture (180-210 seconds)**
*[Screen: Beautiful app UI on multiple devices]*

**"This proves MCP-powered apps can create deeply personal, life-changing experiences. I didn't just build an app - I built my personal health companion."**

*[Screen: Show responsive design across devices]*

### **Call to Action (210-240 seconds)**
*[Screen: Live demo URL and GitHub]*

**"Try it at llakterian.github.io/QuitVaping. Import my Postman collections to see the MCP architecture. And if you're struggling with any addiction - build your own personal solution. Sometimes the best apps aren't built for millions of users. They're built for the one user who needs them most: you."**
