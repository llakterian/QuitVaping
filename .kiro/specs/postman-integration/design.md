### Enhanced User Profile
```typescript
interface EnhancedUserProfile {
  // Existing user data
  userId: string;
  quitDate: Date;
  vapingHistory: VapingHistory;
  
  // New MCP-enhanced fields
  aiPreferences: AIPreferences;
  externalDataSources: ExternalDataSource[];
  communitySettings: CommunitySettings;
  interventionHistory: InterventionRecord[];
  healthInsightsConfig: HealthInsightsConfig;
}
```

### AI Workflow Context
```typescript
interface AIWorkflowContext {
  userId: string;
  currentMood: MoodState;
  recentActivity: UserActivity[];
  externalFactors: ExternalFactors;
  availableInterventions: InterventionType[];
  learningData: UserLearningProfile;
}
```

### MCP Server Response
```typescript
interface MCPServerResponse {
  serverId: string;
  responseType: 'motivation' | 'health' | 'community' | 'intervention' | 'analytics';
  data: any;
  confidence: number;
  nextActions: RecommendedAction[];
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

## Error Handling

### MCP Server Failures
