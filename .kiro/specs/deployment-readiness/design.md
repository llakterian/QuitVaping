## Data Models

### 1. Test Result Model

```dart
class TestResult {
  final String testName;
  final bool passed;
  final String? errorMessage;
  final DateTime timestamp;
  
  TestResult({
    required this.testName,
    required this.passed,
    this.errorMessage,
    required this.timestamp,
  });
}
```

### 2. Performance Metric Model

```dart
class PerformanceMetric {
  final String metricName;
  final double value;
  final String unit;
  final DateTime timestamp;
  final String deviceInfo;
  
  PerformanceMetric({
    required this.metricName,
    required this.value,
    required this.unit,
    required this.timestamp,
    required this.deviceInfo,
  });
}
```

### 3. Deployment Checklist Item Model

```dart
class ChecklistItem {
  final String id;
  final String description;
  final bool completed;
  final String? notes;
  final DateTime? completedAt;
  
  ChecklistItem({
    required this.id,
    required this.description,
    required this.completed,
    this.notes,
    this.completedAt,
  });
}
```

## Error Handling

### 1. Test Failures

When a test fails:

1. Log detailed error information
2. Capture screenshots or state information when possible
3. Categorize the failure (critical, major, minor)
4. Add the issue to a tracking system
5. Prioritize fixes based on severity

### 2. Build Failures

When a build fails:

1. Log the build error
2. Identify the cause (code error, dependency issue, configuration problem)
3. Fix the underlying issue
4. Verify the fix with a new build
5. Document the issue and solution for future reference

### 3. Submission Rejections

When a Play Store submission is rejected:

1. Carefully review the rejection reason
2. Address all issues mentioned in the rejection
3. Test the fixes thoroughly
4. Resubmit with detailed notes on the changes made
5. If necessary, appeal the rejection with supporting information

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Feature Testing

Each feature will be tested using the following approach:

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components and functions
2. **Widget Testing**: Test UI components and interactions
3. **Integration Testing**: Test feature components working together
4. **Manual Testing**: Test the complete feature with real user scenarios
5. **Edge Case Testing**: Test unusual or extreme scenarios

### 2. Cross-Feature Testing

Cross-feature testing will focus on:

1. **Navigation**: Testing navigation between features
2. **Data Sharing**: Testing data consistency across features
3. **State Preservation**: Testing state maintenance when switching features
4. **Performance Impact**: Testing performance when multiple features are used

### 3. UI/UX Testing

UI/UX testing will include:

1. **Visual Consistency**: Testing consistent use of colors, typography, and spacing
2. **Responsive Design**: Testing on different screen sizes and orientations
3. **Accessibility**: Testing with screen readers and other accessibility tools
4. **User Flow**: Testing the intuitiveness of navigation and interactions

### 4. Platform Testing

Platform testing will focus on:

1. **Android Version Compatibility**: Testing on multiple Android versions
2. **Device Compatibility**: Testing on different device profiles
3. **Permission Handling**: Testing permission requests and handling
4. **Background Behavior**: Testing app behavior when in the background

### 5. Performance Testing

Performance testing will measure:

1. **Startup Time**: Time to load the app and reach interactive state
2. **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption during normal and extended use
3. **CPU Usage**: CPU utilization during different operations
4. **Battery Impact**: Battery consumption during typical usage patterns
5. **Network Efficiency**: Efficient use of network resources
