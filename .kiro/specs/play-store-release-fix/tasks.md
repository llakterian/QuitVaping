# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update app version to resolve version conflict
  - Increment the build number in pubspec.yaml from +50 to +51 to create version 1.0.0+51
  - Verify the version format follows Flutter conventions (major.minor.patch+buildNumber)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 2. Clean build environment and regenerate app bundle
  - [x] 2.1 Clean previous build artifacts
    - Run flutter clean to remove all cached build files
    - Run flutter pub get to refresh dependencies
    - _Requirements: 1.3_

  - [x] 2.2 Build signed release bundle
    - Execute flutter build appbundle --release to generate new signed bundle
    - Verify the bundle is created at build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
    - Confirm the bundle size is reasonable and contains expected content
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Verify bundle configuration and metadata
  - [x] 3.1 Check bundle version information
    - Verify the generated bundle contains version code 51
    - Confirm package name is com.llakterian.quitvaping
    - Validate signing configuration is applied correctly
    - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3_

  - [x] 3.2 Test bundle integrity
    - Check bundle file size is within expected range (typically 10-50MB for this app)
    - Verify bundle can be analyzed using bundletool if available
    - _Requirements: 2.2_

- [x] 4. Create deployment script for consistent bundle generation
  - Write a shell script that automates the clean build and bundle generation process
  - Include version verification and bundle validation steps
  - Make the script executable and document its usage
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1_

- [x] 5. Document upload process for Google Play Console
  - Create step-by-step instructions for uploading the new bundle to Play Console
  - Include screenshots or detailed descriptions of the upload interface
  - Document how to create a closed testing release with the new bundle
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Verify Play Console acceptance
  - Upload the new app bundle (version 1.0.0+51) to Google Play Console
  - Confirm the bundle is accepted without version conflict errors
  - Verify all required metadata and configurations are present
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.1_

- [x] 7. Create closed testing release
  - Use the uploaded bundle to create a new closed testing release
  - Verify the release creation process completes without the "no app bundles" error
  - Confirm the release is available for testing
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 8. Test installation and functionality
  - Install the app from Google Play Console internal testing
  - Verify the app launches correctly with the new version
  - Test core functionality to ensure no regressions were introduced
  - _Requirements: 3.4_
