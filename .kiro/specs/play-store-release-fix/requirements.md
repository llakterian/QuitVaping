# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QuitVaping app is encountering a Play Store Console error "This release does not add or remove any app bundles" when attempting to create a closed testing release. This error typically occurs due to version conflicts, where the same version code has already been uploaded, or when there are issues with the app bundle upload process. We need to resolve this issue to successfully publish the app to Google Play Store.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve the Play Store Console bundle upload error, so that I can successfully create a closed testing release.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new release THEN the version code SHALL be incremented to avoid conflicts with previously uploaded versions
2. WHEN the version is updated THEN both the version name and version code SHALL be incremented appropriately
3. WHEN building the app bundle THEN it SHALL generate successfully with the new version
4. WHEN uploading to Play Store Console THEN it SHALL accept the new app bundle without version conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the app bundle is properly signed and configured, so that Google Play Console accepts it for release.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the release bundle THEN it SHALL be signed with the correct release keystore
2. WHEN the bundle is generated THEN it SHALL contain all required metadata and configurations
3. WHEN uploading the bundle THEN it SHALL pass all Google Play Console validation checks
4. WHEN the bundle is processed THEN it SHALL be available for closed testing release creation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the release process is working correctly, so that I can confidently publish updates to the Play Store.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new bundle is uploaded THEN Google Play Console SHALL show it as a valid release candidate
2. WHEN creating a closed testing release THEN it SHALL allow selection of the new app bundle
3. WHEN the release is created THEN it SHALL be available for testing without errors
4. WHEN testers access the app THEN they SHALL be able to install and run the updated version
