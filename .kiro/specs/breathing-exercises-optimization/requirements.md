# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QuitVaping app currently includes a breathing exercises feature that helps users manage cravings and reduce stress. While the existing implementation is functional, there are opportunities to optimize performance, enhance user experience, and add new capabilities. This optimization aims to improve the responsiveness of the breathing exercise player, reduce resource usage, enhance visual feedback, and add new features like background mode and exercise presets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the breathing exercise animations to be smooth and responsive, so that I can focus on my breathing without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts a breathing exercise THEN the system SHALL render animations at a consistent frame rate of at least 60fps
2. WHEN the user switches between breathing phases THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly without stutters or delays
3. WHEN the user uses the app on a lower-end device THEN the system SHALL adapt animation complexity to maintain performance
4. WHEN the user completes multiple breathing sessions THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance without degradation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to continue my breathing exercises while using other apps or when my screen is off, so that I can practice in more flexible ways.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates away from the app during a breathing exercise THEN the system SHALL continue providing audio guidance
2. WHEN the user's screen turns off during a breathing exercise THEN the system SHALL continue the exercise in background mode
3. WHEN the user returns to the app during an active exercise THEN the system SHALL seamlessly resume visual guidance synchronized with the current phase
4. WHEN the user enables background mode THEN the system SHALL provide audio cues that are clear and helpful without visual guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want more detailed visual feedback during breathing exercises, so that I can better synchronize my breathing with the guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is performing a breathing exercise THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing the current position within the phase
2. WHEN the user is approaching a phase transition THEN the system SHALL provide a visual countdown or indicator
3. WHEN the user completes a breathing cycle THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback acknowledging the completion
4. WHEN the user customizes a breathing pattern THEN the system SHALL preview the rhythm visually before starting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and quickly access my favorite breathing patterns, so that I can start my preferred exercises without reconfiguring them each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user customizes a breathing pattern THEN the system SHALL offer an option to save it as a preset
2. WHEN the user views the breathing exercises screen THEN the system SHALL display saved presets at the top for quick access
3. WHEN the user selects a saved preset THEN the system SHALL immediately start the exercise with those settings
4. WHEN the user has multiple saved presets THEN the system SHALL allow renaming, reordering, and deleting them

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the breathing exercise player to use minimal device resources, so that it doesn't drain my battery or cause my device to heat up during longer sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user performs a breathing exercise THEN the system SHALL optimize CPU usage to below 10% on reference devices
2. WHEN the user performs a breathing exercise THEN the system SHALL optimize memory usage to prevent leaks and excessive allocation
3. WHEN the user performs a breathing exercise with audio guidance THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage audio resources
4. WHEN the user performs multiple consecutive sessions THEN the system SHALL properly release resources between sessions
