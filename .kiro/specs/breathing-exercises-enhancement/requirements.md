## Introduction

The QuitVaping app currently includes basic breathing exercises to help users manage cravings and reduce stress. This feature enhancement aims to expand and improve the breathing exercises functionality by adding more exercise types, customization options, guided audio, progress tracking, and integration with other app features. These enhancements will provide users with more effective tools for managing nicotine cravings and stress, which are critical components of a successful quitting journey.
