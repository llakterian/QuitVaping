# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for creating, organizing, and verifying all necessary app store assets for the QuitVaping app. The design focuses on ensuring all visual assets and metadata meet Google Play Store requirements while maintaining a consistent brand identity and using only free, properly attributed images.

## Architecture

The app store assets will be organized according to the following structure:

```
play_store_assets/
├── graphics/
│   ├── app_icon.png (512x512)
│   ├── feature_graphic.png (1024x500)
│   ├── app_icon_source.jpg (source file)
│   └── feature_graphic_source.jpg (source file)
├── screenshots/
│   ├── phone/
│   │   ├── en-US/
│   │   │   ├── screenshot_1.png
│   │   │   ├── screenshot_2.png
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── screenshot_overlay_source.jpg
│   └── tablet/ (if applicable)
│       └── en-US/
│           ├── screenshot_1.png
│           └── ...
├── email.txt
├── phone.txt
├── website.txt
├── privacy_policy_url.txt
├── short_description.txt
├── full_description.txt
└── image_resources_guide.md
```

This structure ensures all assets are properly organized and easily accessible for app store submission.

## Data Models

### Image Attribution Model
For each image used in the app store assets, the following information will be tracked:

```
{
  "filename": "image_name.png",
  "source": "Source website (e.g., Pexels, Unsplash)",
  "author": "Creator's name (if available)",
  "license": "License type",
  "requiresAttribution": boolean,
  "attributionText": "Text to include if attribution required",
  "url": "Original image URL"
}
```

This information will be stored in the `image_credits.md` file.

## Error Handling

### Image Verification
- Check image dimensions match requirements
- Verify PNG format for all assets
- Ensure file sizes are optimized for web

### Metadata Verification
- Validate text lengths against requirements
- Check for spelling and grammar errors
- Verify all required fields are completed

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Asset Testing
1. **Dimension Verification**
   - Verify all images meet size requirements
   - Check aspect ratios are correct

2. **Visual Quality Testing**
   - Review images at different zoom levels
   - Check for pixelation or compression artifacts

3. **Brand Consistency Testing**
   - Ensure colors match app's theme
   - Verify logo usage is consistent

### Metadata Testing
1. **Content Verification**
   - Check character counts for descriptions
   - Verify contact information is valid
   - Ensure privacy policy URL works

2. **Compliance Testing**
   - Run verification script to check all requirements
   - Review against app store compliance checklist

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow these steps:

1. **Asset Creation**
   - Source appropriate free images
   - Create app icon and feature graphic
   - Capture and prepare screenshots

2. **Metadata Preparation**
   - Finalize app descriptions
   - Verify contact information
   - Ensure privacy policy is accessible

3. **Organization**
   - Place all assets in the correct directories
   - Document image sources and attributions

4. **Verification**
   - Run verification scripts
   - Complete compliance checklist
   - Make any necessary adjustments

This approach ensures all app store assets are properly prepared, organized, and verified before submission.
