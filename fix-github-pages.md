# 🔧 Fix GitHub Pages Environment Protection Rules

## ✅ **Issue Fixed:**
The deployment was failing because GitHub's environment protection rules don't allow the `master` branch to deploy to GitHub Pages. I've switched to the `main` branch.

## 🚀 **What I Did:**
1. ✅ Merged all changes from `master` to `main` branch
2. ✅ Updated workflow to trigger on `main` branch
3. ✅ Fixed all build errors (missing assets, deprecated APIs)
4. ✅ Pushed to `main` branch

## 🎯 **Next Steps - IMPORTANT:**

### **Step 1: Set Main as Default Branch**
1. Go to: https://github.com/llakterian/QuitVaping/settings/branches
2. Click "Switch to another branch" next to "Default branch"
3. Select `main` as the default branch
4. Click "Update"
5. Confirm the change

### **Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages**
1. Go to: https://github.com/llakterian/QuitVaping/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click "Save"

### **Step 3: Check Deployment**
1. Go to: https://github.com/llakterian/QuitVaping/actions
2. The latest workflow should be running on the `main` branch
3. It should complete successfully now (no environment protection errors)

## 🔍 **Why This Happened:**
GitHub repositories created recently have `main` as the default branch, but older repos use `master`. GitHub Pages environment protection rules are typically configured for the default branch (`main`), which is why `master` was rejected.

## ✅ **Current Status:**
- ✅ All code is on `main` branch
- ✅ Workflow triggers on `main` branch  
- ✅ Build errors fixed
- ✅ Ready for deployment

The deployment should work now! Check the Actions tab in a few minutes to see it complete successfully.
