# App Icon Design for QuitVaping

## Design Concept

The app icon for QuitVaping will feature a simple, clean design that represents the app's purpose of helping users quit vaping and improve their health. The design will incorporate the following elements:

1. **Main Symbol**: A stylized lung or breath symbol in white or light color
2. **Background**: A gradient background using the app's primary colors (green to blue)
3. **Shape**: Rounded square (squircle) shape following modern app icon design principles
4. **Style**: Minimalist and clean, focusing on a single recognizable symbol

## Color Palette

Based on the app's color scheme:
- Primary Green: #4CAF50
- Secondary Blue: #42A5F5
- Background Gradient: From #43CEA2 (Teal) to #185A9D (Deep Blue)
- Symbol Color: White (#FFFFFF)

## Design Elements

1. **Lung/Breath Symbol**: A simple, stylized representation of healthy lungs or a breath of fresh air
2. **Gradient Background**: Smooth gradient from teal to deep blue, representing the journey from health to calmness
3. **Rounded Corners**: Following the standard app icon shape with appropriate corner radius

## Technical Specifications

- Size: 512x512 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency
- DPI: 72 dpi (standard for digital displays)
- Color Mode: RGB

## Design Variations

1. **Primary Design**: Lung symbol on gradient background
2. **Alternative Design**: Breath wave symbol on gradient background
3. **Simple Design**: Letter "Q" (for Quit) with a small leaf element

## Implementation Notes

The final app icon should be created using vector graphics software to ensure crisp edges and proper scaling. The PNG export should maintain transparency where needed and follow the Play Store guidelines for app icons.

The icon should be recognizable at small sizes (as it will appear on users' home screens) while maintaining its visual impact at larger sizes (as seen in the Play Store).
