# Feature Graphic Design for QuitVaping

## Design Concept

The feature graphic for QuitVaping will showcase the app's main benefit of helping users quit vaping and improve their health. The design will incorporate the following elements:

1. **Main Image**: A calming, health-focused image that represents freedom from vaping
2. **Text Overlay**: Minimal text highlighting the app's main benefit
3. **Color Scheme**: Consistent with the app's primary colors (green and blue)
4. **Style**: Clean, modern, and inspiring

## Color Palette

Based on the app's color scheme:
- Primary Green: #4CAF50
- Secondary Blue: #42A5F5
- Background Gradient: From #43CEA2 (Teal) to #185A9D (Deep Blue)
- Text Color: White (#FFFFFF)

## Design Elements

1. **Background Image**: A person enjoying fresh air in nature or a calming wellness scene
2. **Gradient Overlay**: Semi-transparent gradient using the app's colors
3. **Text**: "BREATHE FREELY" or "QUIT VAPING, START LIVING"
4. **App Icon**: Small app icon in one corner for brand recognition

## Technical Specifications

- Size: 1024x500 pixels
- Format: PNG
- DPI: 72 dpi (standard for digital displays)
- Color Mode: RGB

## Layout

The feature graphic will follow a simple, balanced layout:
- Background image covering the entire canvas
- Semi-transparent gradient overlay to ensure text readability
- Text positioned for maximum impact (centered or rule of thirds)
- App icon in the bottom right corner

## Implementation Notes

The final feature graphic should be created using image editing software to combine the source image with text and gradient overlays. The PNG export should follow the Play Store guidelines for feature graphics.

The graphic should be visually appealing and clearly communicate the app's purpose at a glance, as it will be one of the first things potential users see in the Play Store.
