# Memory Optimization for Breathing Exercises

This document outlines the memory optimization strategies implemented for the breathing exercises feature.

## Components

### 1. BreathingMemoryOptimizer

A singleton class that manages memory usage by:
- Tracking and estimating memory usage
- Caching images and assets efficiently
- Cleaning up unused resources periodically
- Providing methods for loading and releasing resources

### 2. BreathingResourceManager

A singleton class that manages resource lifecycle by:
- Tracking active resources
- Prioritizing resource loading
- Managing resource queues
- Providing methods for registering and unregistering resources

### 3. ImageCacheOptimizer

A utility class that optimizes Flutter's image cache by:
- Adjusting cache size based on device performance
- Providing methods for evicting images
- Optimizing image providers with appropriate sizing

### 4. MemoryLeakDetector

A widget that detects and helps fix memory leaks by:
- Monitoring memory usage over time
- Detecting consistent memory increases
- Triggering cleanup when leaks are detected
- Providing debug information

### 5. MemoryOptimizedContainer

A container widget that applies memory optimization to its children by:
- Monitoring app lifecycle changes
- Cleaning up resources when app goes to background
- Adapting to performance metrics
- Wrapping content with leak detection

### 6. BreathingMemoryService

A service that initializes and coordinates all memory optimization components by:
- Initializing components in the correct order
- Monitoring memory usage periodically
- Notifying listeners of memory warnings
- Providing methods for cleanup and statistics

## Usage

1. Initialize the memory service at app startup:
```dart
await BreathingMemoryService.instance.initialize();
```

2. Wrap breathing exercise screens with MemoryOptimizedContainer:
```dart
MemoryOptimizedContainer(
  child: YourWidget(),
)
```

3. Register resources when they are needed:
```dart
BreathingResourceManager.instance.registerResource('resource_id');
```

4. Unregister resources when they are no longer needed:
```dart
BreathingResourceManager.instance.unregisterResource('resource_id');
```

5. Use OptimizedImageWidget for efficient image loading:
```dart
OptimizedImageWidget(
  assetPath: 'assets/images/example.jpg',
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
)
```

## Memory Optimization Strategies

1. **Resource Lifecycle Management**
   - Track resource usage
   - Clean up unused resources
   - Prioritize active resources

2. **Image Caching Optimization**
   - Adjust cache size based on device performance
   - Use appropriate image resolutions
   - Evict unused images

3. **Memory Leak Detection**
   - Monitor memory usage patterns
   - Detect consistent memory increases
   - Trigger cleanup when leaks are detected

4. **Adaptive Resource Usage**
   - Scale resource usage based on device capabilities
   - Reduce quality on low-end devices
   - Use higher quality on high-end devices

5. **Background Mode Optimization**
   - Aggressively clean up when app goes to background
   - Restore resources when app returns to foreground
   - Prioritize essential resources

## Performance Impact

These optimizations result in:
- Reduced memory footprint
- Fewer out-of-memory crashes
- Smoother animations
- Better battery life
- Improved overall app responsiveness
