# üöÄ Manual Deployment Trigger

This file is created to trigger GitHub Actions deployment.

Timestamp: $(date)

## Steps to ensure deployment works:

1. **Check GitHub Pages Settings**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/llakterian/QuitVaping/settings/pages
   - Source should be set to "GitHub Actions"
   - NOT "Deploy from a branch"

2. **Manual Workflow Trigger**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/llakterian/QuitVaping/actions
   - Click "Deploy QuitVaping App to GitHub Pages"
   - Click "Run workflow" button
   - Select "master" branch
   - Click "Run workflow"

3. **Check Workflow Status**:
   - Monitor the Actions tab for progress
   - Look for any error messages

4. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Once complete, visit: https://llakterian.github.io/QuitVaping/
   - Should show your QuitVaping app

## Common Issues:

- **Pages not enabled**: Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
- **Wrong source**: Must use "GitHub Actions" not branch deployment
- **Permissions**: Workflow needs pages write permission (already configured)
- **Branch mismatch**: Workflow triggers on master/main (already configured)

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Workflow file exists
- ‚úÖ Target file (main_final_web.dart) exists  
- ‚úÖ Web dependencies (pubspec_web.yaml) configured
- ‚úÖ Pushed to master branch
- ‚è≥ Waiting for GitHub Pages configuration/manual trigger
