# 🔧 Fix GitHub Pages Settings - URGENT

## 🚨 **The Problem:**
Your site is still showing CSP errors because GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from the wrong branch.

## ✅ **The Solution (2 minutes):**

### **Step 1: Go to GitHub Pages Settings**
1. Open: https://github.com/llakterian/QuitVaping/settings/pages
2. You'll see a "Source" section

### **Step 2: Change the Source**
Currently it's probably set to:
- ❌ **"Deploy from a branch: main"** 

Change it to:
- ✅ **"Deploy from a branch: gh-pages"**
- ✅ **Folder: "/ (root)"**

### **Step 3: Save**
Click "Save" button

### **Step 4: Wait 2-3 minutes**
GitHub Pages will redeploy from the correct branch

## 🎯 **Why This Fixes Everything:**

- The `gh-pages` branch has the CORRECT version (no CSP header)
- The `main` branch has the OLD version (with CSP header)
- GitHub Pages was deploying from `main` instead of `gh-pages`

## 🌍 **After the fix:**
Your app at https://llakterian.github.io/QuitVaping/ will:
- ✅ Load without CSP errors
- ✅ Show the beautiful loading screen
- ✅ Work perfectly on all devices

## 🚀 **Alternative: Force GitHub Pages to Use gh-pages**

If the settings page doesn't show the option, you can also:
1. Go to: https://github.com/llakterian/QuitVaping/settings
2. Scroll down to "GitHub Pages"
3. Under "Source", select "gh-pages branch"

**This is the final fix! Your app will be live in 2-3 minutes after changing the source!** 🎉
